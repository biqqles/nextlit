# Nextlit

The [LP5523](http://www.ti.com/product/LP5523)-controlled segmented LEDs on the rear of the [Nextbit Robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextbit_Robin) are one of the device's most unique features. Yet they see very little use, being used only for effects relating to the now-defunct "Smart Storage" in the stock ROM and simply displaying a pattern during boot in custom ROMs. Nextlit rectifies this by employing these lights as a useful notification indicator.

Nextlit allows you to preview the five patterns programmed into the LP5523 by Nextbit plus another five unique to the app, and select one to activate when a notification is received. You can configure patterns for individual apps, letting you identify which app requires your attention without needing to wake your phone. Nextlit exploits the potential of the segmented LEDs to encode greater meaning than can be expressed with the standard notification light and looks cool while doing it.

If you want to use the app for any more than simply previewing the available patterns you'll need to give its service notification access. The application does not read nor care about the contents of notifications; the only thing it does is count them. You can see the relevant routines [here](app/src/main/java/eu/biqqles/nextlit/NotificationLightsService.java).

The app needs root access in order to access `/sys` but will work on any ROM. Nextlit has been [featured on XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/nextlit-nextbit-robin-led-notifications/) and is free software, released under the Mozilla General Public License version 2.0.

### Further ideas
- user-definable patterns
    - necessitates an [assembler for the LP5523's instruction set](http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/snvc151)
- music visualisation
- BCD clock
- (optionally) disable lights while charging
